This PDF-based Linux environment can boot a real Linux kernel directly inside Chromium-based browsers with PDF viewer support for embedded JavaScript.

## üí° Project Overview

PDFs are typically used for static content ‚Äî but this project takes things further by embedding a RISC-V emulator compiled via Emscripten (asm.js) into a PDF file. The result: an interactive Linux terminal that runs directly in-browser from a PDF.

The interface includes a virtual keyboard and text box for input, while output is rendered using ASCII characters mapped to PDF form fields.

This is a reimagined and educational take on virtual computing within constrained environments like PDFs.

## üöÄ Features

- Run a real Linux OS from inside a PDF
- No installations or extensions required
- Fully self-contained emulator
- 32-bit and 64-bit root filesystem support
- Minimalistic UI for interaction (text + keyboard)
- Portable and hackable

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

This project must be built on a **Linux system**.

Clone and set up the environment:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/pritisingh-09/PDFLinuxVM.git
cd PDFLinuxVM

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./build.sh

If you want to build the 64-bit version, open the build.sh file and change:
BITS="32"
to
BITS="64"
Once built, the output files will be placed in the out/ directory.

To test locally, run:
cd out
python3 -m http.server
Then open http://localhost:8000/linux.pdf in a Chromium browser.
```
Output
All PDF and emulator files are exported to the out/ folder after a successful build. You can share or embed the linux.pdf file wherever needed.

Background
PDFLinuxVM is inspired by the capabilities of JavaScript in PDF viewers. Although most browser-based PDF engines (like Chromium's PDFium) implement a restricted version of Adobe‚Äôs JavaScript API, it‚Äôs still possible to run logic-heavy code using asm.js compiled C programs.

The Linux boot process is significantly slower in this environment (up to 100x) due to the absence of JIT compilation in browser PDF engines. Still, it‚Äôs an impressive demonstration of constrained computing inside document formats.
